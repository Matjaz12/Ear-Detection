# Ear-Detection

In this work we compare performance of two popular real-time
detection algorithms Viola-Jones (VJ) and YOLO. Algorithms
are evaluated on the task of ear detection. We vary parameters
of VJ and report performance (mean intersection over union
(mean IoU) and mean accuracy precision (mAP@[0;0.01;1]))
for each parameter set. We experiment with a parameter called
”numDetections” and show that is somewhat correlated with
the confidence of the model. Finally we take a look at a subset
of predictions and try to elaborate on the results.
